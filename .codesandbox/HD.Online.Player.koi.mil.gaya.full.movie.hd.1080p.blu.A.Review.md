*Koi Mil Gaya* is not just a sci-fi movie, but also a heartwarming story of friendship, courage, and love. Rohit's bond with Jadoo is the highlight of the movie, as they help each other overcome their challenges and discover their true potential. Rohit also finds love and acceptance from Nisha, who sees beyond his disability and supports him throughout his journey. The movie also explores the themes of family, loyalty, and sacrifice, as Rohit's mother Sonia (Rekha) tries to protect him from the dangers of the world and his father's legacy.
 
The movie was inspired by several Hollywood films, such as *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial*, *Close Encounters of the Third Kind*, and *Star Wars*. However, it also has its own originality and charm, as it blends Indian culture and values with sci-fi elements. The movie features several memorable scenes, such as Rohit's basketball match, Jadoo's magic show, Rohit's transformation into a superhuman, and the final chase sequence. The movie also has some humorous moments, thanks to Johnny Lever's comic role as Chelaram Sukhwani, Rohit's friend and landlord.
 
The movie was a breakthrough for Hrithik Roshan, who delivered a stunning performance as Rohit. He convincingly portrayed the character's physical and mental challenges, as well as his emotional growth and transformation. He also displayed his dancing skills in the songs \"Idhar Chala Main Udhar Chala\" and \"It's Magic\". Preity Zinta was equally impressive as Nisha, who brought grace and charm to her role. Rekha was praised for her dignified and touching portrayal of Sonia. The supporting cast, including Rajat Bedi, Prem Chopra, Mukesh Rishi, and Anuj Pandit, also did a commendable job.
 
The movie was also a technical marvel, as it used advanced visual effects and sound design to create a realistic and immersive experience. The alien Jadoo was created by Mark Clobe and Craig Mumma using animatronics and computer-generated imagery. The spaceship was designed by James Colmer and built by Weta Workshop in New Zealand. The sound effects were created by Resul Pookutty and Leslie Fernandes using Dolby Digital EX technology. The movie also featured spectacular action sequences choreographed by Tony Ching Siu-Tung.
